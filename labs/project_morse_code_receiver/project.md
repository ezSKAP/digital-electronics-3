   [PROJECT REPOSITORY](https://github.com/Hans22301/digital-electronics-1/tree/main/labs/project_morse_code_receiver)
   
   This project was created in Vivado 2020.2 so there is big chance bit stream wont be uplodable on board.
   (There was a human error while instaling Vivado on  our  computers.)

## Project objectives

Main objective of our project is learning how direct hardware programming works.

In this exact project  is our objective to complete "Morse code reciever" and we decided to  devide this into smaller objectives:
1. Create character map for seven segment display that will work for all  characters and numbers.

2. Create source file for our project that would insert buttons entries as zeroes and ones(. = 0 , _ = 1) and shift them into memory.
	
3. Create TOP source file that would use our translate program and our inserting program and with help from seven segment driver and clock enabling program, to show recieved character.

## Hardware description

As our hardware we are using board Nexys A7-50t.

![your figure](https://github.com/Hans22301/digital-electronics-1/blob/main/labs/project_morse_code_receiver/images/deska_orig.png)

On this board we will use 4 buttons as our inputs(UP = _, DOWN =., CENTER = ENTER, LEFT = BACKSPACE), 100MHz clock, seven segment display to print out final characters.

## VHDL modules description and simulations

**IMPUTT**

This module is created to take button presses, depending on button thats been pressed, the module will assign value (UP will assign 1 and DOWN will assign 0), pressing left button will delete last value(in case of input  mistake) and center button works as enter and will end the input phase of character.

**TRANSLATE**

Translate module works as character map, morse code input will be translated into code input for seven segment display driver and exported to hex_7seg module.

**CLOCK_ENABLE**

This module is exact one we used in previous lectures, because we didnt need to rewrite anything. Its used to create input 100MHz clock signal.

**HEX_7SEG**
This module works very similar to the one we programmed in lecture, but we rewrote it to work for us(added all characters in alphabet) as seen in next picture.

## TOP module description and simulations

**TOP module**

Top module is made to combine all other modules together and make them work for our hardware board. So basicaly it takes all inputs and combine them  with our  constrains file (direct property setting for exact board periferies).

**SIMULATION**

In the upcoming picture we can see time simulation in base case, without any input.

Picture number two is simulated phrase "SOS" in morse code.
